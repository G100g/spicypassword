# Spicy Password

Playing with Redux + React, creating a simple password generator to have different passwords on different websites,
recreating them from a simple rule.

Insert a password, a domain *(es. facebook.com)* and a password will be generated,
hashing your password and the domain.

Try the result on https://g100g.github.io/spicypassword/
